    One u128 stores the entire cube's state.
    Orientations & permutations are stored in terms of places where cubies should be in relation to where they are,
    as opposed to cubies relative to their solved position.
    This makes calculating orientation (& permutation?) easier.
    A solved cube has state 0.
    A cube in G1 has corner orientations = 0, edge orientations 4, 5, 6 & 7 = 0, and UD slice = 0
    
    The first 60 least significant bits represent edge orientation & permutation - 1 bit per cubie.
      The least significant bit of each cubie represents orientation:
      0 -> Ex-Ey, ey-ex
      1 -> Ex-ey, Ey-ex
      
      The 4 most significant bits of each cubie represent edge permutation - 4 bits per cubie:
      0 -> in solved permutation
      n -> solved permutation + n (modulo 12)
      So e8 in the solved position of e2 has permutation 8,
      and e3 in the solved position of e6 has permutation 3
    
    The next 16 least significant bits represent corner orientation - 2 bits per cubie:
    0b00 -> solved position
    0b01 -> rotated clockwise
    0b10 -> rotated Anticlockwise
    
    The next 24 least significant bits represent corner permutation - 3 bits per cubie.
    These work in the same manner as edge orientation, but modulo 8 rather than 12.
    
    The next 4 least sugnificant bits represent whether the UD slice cubies are in the UD slice or not.
    From least significant to most, the bits represent e4, e5, e6 & e7.
    0 = in UD slice
    1 = not in UD slice
    UD slice could be calculated from the edge permutations, but this should be more efficientâ„¢.
    This is needed to check whether we're in G1 or not.
    
    And we still have 24 spare bits!
